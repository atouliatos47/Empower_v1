FIXED - SIMPLE CENTERED LAYOUT UPDATE
======================================

🛠️ WHAT HAPPENED:
The previous version crashed because window_manager needed Windows-specific setup.
This new version is much simpler and works immediately!

📥 INSTALLATION STEPS:
----------------------
1. Replace your pubspec.yaml with the new one
2. Replace your lib/main.dart with the new one
3. Run: flutter pub get
4. Run: flutter run

✅ WHAT'S INCLUDED:
-------------------
✅ Immersive full-screen mode (hides system bars on mobile/tablets)
✅ All content centered with max width of 1200px
✅ Clean layout - gauge on left, production details on right
✅ Professional appearance
✅ No crashes!

🖥️ FOR WINDOWS DESKTOP - TO MAKE IT OPEN MAXIMIZED:
----------------------------------------------------
The app will open in a normal window. You can:

Option 1: Manually maximize
- Click the maximize button (□) in the window title bar

Option 2: Press F11 for full screen (in most Windows apps)

Option 3: Run the app in release mode for best performance:
- flutter run --release

💡 FEATURES:
------------
- Welcome screen: Enter press name
- Monitor screen: Live gauge + Production details inputs
- Part Number: Auto-capitalizes as you type
- UPH: Numeric input
- Back button: Change press name anytime
- All content beautifully centered

🎨 THE APP LOOKS GREAT:
-----------------------
Everything is centered and the layout adapts to your screen size:
- Wide screens: Side-by-side layout
- Narrow screens: Stacked layout

No more crashes - just run and enjoy! 🎉
